# EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset-using-Python

Explored the Titanic Dataset using Python for a hands-on data analysis project. 
Unveiled compelling insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), employing Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries. 
From survival rates to passenger demographics, this project offers a glimpse into the intriguing patterns within the Titanic data.
EDA is done on dataset of those people who travelled on Titanic ship in 1912.
This dataset is being downloaded from Kaggle website.
This analysis is mainly targeted on "Number of people Survived" during the incident and also, considers the factors which may affected the Surviving rate of those people.

# Overview
This GitHub repository showcases a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from the dataset, shedding light on various aspects of the tragic event, and demonstrating the power of Python for data analysis.

# Dataset Information
The Titanic dataset is renowned in the data science community for providing a glimpse into the demographics of the passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic, including crucial details like age, gender, class, and survival status. The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle website, and it includes the following columns:

1) PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
2) Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
3) Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
4) Name: Passenger's name.
5) Sex: Passenger's gender.
6) Age: Passenger's age.
7) SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
8) Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
9) Ticket: Ticket number.
10) Fare: Passenger fare.
11) Cabin: Cabin number.
12) Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
